 I am a dedicated tutor. I have been in this profession for last 5 years. Teaching student is a good hobby where I can still
learn a lot or recall the things I learned when I was small. I love spending time with kids because after all the tiresome you
can go and be with younger people and feel young again and you can be a mentor to them and help them understand the meaning of
life. I can guide them to be a better person and help them understand the difference between right and wrong.
This is one of the reason it got me close to my students hence they get close with me.
This is something I look forward and this is one of the qualityI possess. From my childhood experiences Ican help this younger
people to become a better human being.
